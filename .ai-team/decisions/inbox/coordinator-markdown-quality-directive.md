# Markdown Formatting Quality Directive

## 2026-02-16

**By:** User (via Coordinator)

**What:** When creating new Markdown files, scan and resolve formatting issues in the documents before finalizing. Ensure compliance with project Markdown standards defined in `.github/instructions/markdown.instructions.md`.

**Why:** Maintain consistent, high-quality documentation across the project from creation time rather than requiring later cleanup passes.
